The time it took you to complete

- It took around 3 hours to complete the entire assignment.

What took the most time / what was tricky?

- The phone masking part and the CSS for the 'EVEN MORE SAVINGS' portion was the difficult part. But after grinding through internet articles I was able to create the UI as per the figma

Any final thoughts or comments are welcome

- Overall it was a very nice experience, and enjoyed a lot while completing the assignment
